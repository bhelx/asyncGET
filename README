asyncGET

This program is quite bare, it is meant to be extended. I have only implemented one MODE as of yet. 
Give it a text file with urls separated by newlines and it will download all of them asynchronously.

BUILDING

You need ant [http://ant.apache.org/] to build. CD to the asyncGET directory then just run the ant command.
This will create a 'bin' and a 'dist' folder. 

RUNNING

Here is an example command:


java -jar dist/asyncGET.jar test/resources/test-urls-small.txt myoutputdirectory 30
